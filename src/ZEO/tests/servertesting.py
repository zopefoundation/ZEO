# Testing the current ZEO implementation is rather hard due to the
# architecture, which mixes concerns, especially between application
# and networking.  Still, it's not as bad as it could be.

# The 2 most important classes in the architecture are ZEOStorage and
# StorageServer. A ZEOStorage is created for each client connection.
# The StorageServer maintains data shared or needed for coordination
# among clients.

# The other important part of the architecture is connections.
# Connections are used by ZEOStorages to send messages or return data
# to clients.

# Here, we'll try to provide some testing infrastructure to isolate
# servers from the network.
